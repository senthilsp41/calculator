    <h1>kalpana chawla</h1>
    <p>alpana Chawla was born on 17 March 1962 in a Punjabi Hindu family in Karnal, Haryana.[11][12] The youngest of four children, she was born into a conservative society, but Chawla broke several traditions to become the first Indian-born female astronaut. She completed her schooling at Tagore Baal Niketan Senior Secondary School, Karnal. Growing up, Chawla went to local flying clubs and watched planes with her father.[13] After graduating with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College, India, Chawla moved to the United States in 1982. In 1984, she graduated with a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington,[14] and went on to earn a second Master's in 1986 and a PhD[15] in aerospace engineering in 1988 from the University of Colorado Boulder.[16][17]</p>
